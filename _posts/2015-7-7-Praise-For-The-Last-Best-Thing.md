#### Grady Harp, on Amazon
> "This is one surprisingly fine debut!...  [Kate's] way with dialogue is unpretentious, at times hilarious while at other times desperately sensitive that the mouths and minds of her characters speak in a fashion that makes them and their status wholly credible…. Treat yourself to one of the more refreshing new authors to be published this year. Think AM Holmes, Alice Hoffman, Sue Monk Kidd, Joyce Carol Oates, Annie Proulx. And now remember to read Kate Sebeny."

#### Trudi LoPreto, for Readers' Favorite
> "The Last Best Thing is not like any other book I have ever read. It touched things in my own life that are a natural part of growing old with humor, wisdom and love. Kate Sebeny has written a story that will make you cry, make you laugh, and make you say what if. I highly recommend this book to all… you will not want to put it down until the very last page."

#### The Book On My Desk, UK Reviewer
> "The Best Thing"

#### Sophia Carleton, UK Reviewer
> "Quirky. Heartwarming. Uplifting. Not normally words you'd associate with a story about euthanasia, the ravages of age and terminal illness. Yet that’s exactly what I was left with after reading The Last Best Thing…. There’s real potential here for this novella to become a full blown novel. However, it is damn near perfect as it is: a bite-size treat of thought provoking escapism to the American Midwest."
