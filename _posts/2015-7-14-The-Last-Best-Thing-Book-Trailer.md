#### Trudi LoPreto, for Readers' Favorite
> "The Last Best Thing is not like any other book I have ever read. It touched things in my own life that are a natural part of growing old with humor, wisdom and love. Kate Sebeny has written a story that will make you cry, make you laugh, and make you say what if. I highly recommend this book to allâ€¦ you will not want to put it down until the very last page."
