I was selected as the focus of [Kellan Publishing's Author Focus Week](http://www.kellanpublishing.com/wordpress/2015/07/28/focus-kate-sebeny-on-the-last-best-thing/)!

Check out my [focus interview](http://www.kellanpublishing.com/wordpress/2015/07/27/focus-interview-with-kate-sebeny/) that discusses my latest novella titled "[The Last Best Thing](http://kellanpublishing.3dcartstores.com/The-Last-Best-Thing_p_34.html?AffId=9)". As a part of the Author Focus week you can even [read the first chapter](http://www.kellanpublishing.com/wordpress/2015/07/29/the-last-best-thing/) of The Last Best Thing. Stay tuned at Kellan Publishing and make sure to [enter the raffle](http://kellanpublishing.com/index.php/raffles/) this week for a free copy of The Last Best Thing.

Also coming up in August is another book signing at [Plain Talk Books](http://www.raccoonforks.com/plain-talk-books-coffee/) in Des Moines, Iowa's historic East Village district.  This is a "wine & sign" event with some jumping blues music.  Hope to see you there!

Finally, I was recently feature on [Snowflakes in a Blizzard](https://snowflakesarise.wordpress.com/2015/07/27/weather-report-july-27/), a site that claims to be "separating authors from the herd and giving them one-on-one time with readers".

> Besides offering the first presidential primary of the election season, Iowa is also known for writing and writers, and Kate Sebeny is very much a part of that scene. She graduated from the University of Iowa’s writing program — considered one of the top five in the nation — and has since edited a weekly newspaper and a national magazine. At one point, she lived in a renovated former county jail in in Winterset, IA, the setting for Robert James Waller’s best-selling "The Bridges of Madison County." She has also taught writing at two Iowa colleges.
> 
> Kate calls her latest novel "a sort of geriatric big chill."
