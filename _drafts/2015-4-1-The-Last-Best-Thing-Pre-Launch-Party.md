While you're here, please register to receive 20% off of the book's purchase price, redeemable through Kellan Publication upon purchase of the book. Registration will also allow you to help me celebrate my upcoming book debut with a virtual pre-launch party from April 1-11.  You will automatically be eligible to win prizes of signed print copies, e-books and other book-related merchandise.

I hope this story will enrich your life as much as the writing of it did mine. That is, after all, a writer's main goal: to be read so that she can impart to her readers what she's learned in the process of writing. You are the reason writers write.

Happy reading and all the best to you. ~Kate
